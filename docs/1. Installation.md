# Installation

This guide provides steps to install software necessary for 
SDL 2 library and C++17 code development on Ubuntu and Windows 10 (via WSL).   

Required software:
1. Git (for fetching/updating libs)
2. C++ 17 compliant compiler (such as G++ v7+) 
3. SDL 2 library


### Ubuntu / Debian

1. Install Git
```bash
apt install git
```

2. Install G++ (7) compiler 
```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
sudo apt update
sudo apt install g++-7 -y
```

3. Install SDL 2 library
```bash
add-apt-repository universe
apt install libsdl2-2.0
apt install libsdl2-dev
```

Steps tested on: Ubuntu 16.04


### Windows 10 (via WSL/Ubuntu)  

The following steps allow to run graphical applications using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) 
and Ubuntu from Windows Store.

1. Install Ubuntu from Windows Store:  
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/ubuntu/9nblggh4msv6

2. Use Ubuntu/WSL bash to setup and configure missing packages by following steps 
for Ubuntu given above

3. Install XMing server to run graphical apps on WSL (from Ubuntu Bash):  
https://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/

4. Run XMing server application

5. Use XMing as display on WSL Ubuntu bash:
```bash
export DISPLAY=:0
```
6. Run graphical application from bash

Note: WSL doesn't support graphical programs natively, and still has troubles with 
DBUS, so display may be incorrect for some programs.

Steps tested on: Windows 10 (Version 10.0.16299.431)
