# Dependency management

1. Initially clone dependencies (optionally can pass compiler commands)
```bash
./init_depends.sh CXX=g++-7
```

2. Install dependencies (optionally can pass compiler commands)
```bash
./install_depends.sh CXX=g++-7
```

3. Update dependencies in future (optionally can pass compiler commands)
```bash
./update_depends.sh CXX=g++-7
```
