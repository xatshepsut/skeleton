# Dependency management

1. Initially clone dependencies and install them in project root.
```bash
./tools/deps/init.sh CXX=g++-7
```
2. Update already cloned dependencies and install them in project root.
```bash
./tools/deps/update.sh CXX=g++-7
```
3. Install already cloned dependencies in project root. This script is used internally by init.sh and update.sh, so you don't usually need it, but it can be useful in some situations. For example, if compilation fails because of wrong make parameters, you can skip the cloning/updating phase, and jump straight to installation.
```bash
./tools/deps/install.sh CXX=g++-7
```

All scripts accept make parameters, as shown in the examples.
Always make sure to run the scripts from the project root.
Dependencies are cloned into a .dependencies directory in the project root.
