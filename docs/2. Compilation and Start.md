# Compilation and start

1. Initially run `./tools/deps/init.sh` (optionally providing make parameters), to fetch and install dependencies. 
```bash
./tools/deps/init.sh CXX=g++-7
```

Note: Run this at least once in the beginning in order to fetch all necessary libs.

2. To compile, use `make` and provide C++ 17 in options if its not set by default
```bash
make CXX=g++-7
```

3. After compilation results will be in `/out` folder by default. 
Find there the program and run it, for example run
```bash
./out/main
```
